          Hello! My name is Nils and im a Front End Developer from Stockholm
          Sweden. <br /> Im a super positive person and very good at the social
          part, im in love with programing, especially Javascript and React,{" "}
          <br /> but if you ask me to build a AI for NASA in Svelte, Vue or any
          other libraray i will do. I love the challenge and freedom tat
          programing gives you, and the endless opurtunities, your imagination
          is the only thing that sets the limit of what you can do. <br />
          Im really hungry to learn and love all different kind of challenges,
          Especially if they keep you awake all night.
